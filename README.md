# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Python script implements a simple command-line version of Tic-Tac-Toe, allowing users to play against an artificial intelligence (AI) opponent. The game provides two modes: one where the computer's moves are randomly, and another where the AI uses an algorithm strategy to make more strategic moves


The game provides more than one algorithm in each code like:

1)Breadth-first search algorithm
2)Depth-first search algorithm
3)Depth-limited search algorithm
4)Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search
5)bidirectional search algorithm

Key Features:

1)Interactive Gameplay:
  Players can make their moves by entering a number corresponding to the position on the 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board.

2)Random Move AI (play_game()):
  The computer opponent makes random moves, providing a simple opponent for the player.

3)Algorithm
  The computer opponent utilizes each algorithm strategy to make more intelligent moves.
  each algorithm strategy aims to block the player from winning and prioritize winning moves for the computer.

4)Winning Detection:
  The script checks for a winner after each move, considering rows, columns, and diagonals.

5)Tie Detection:
  The game recognizes when the board is full, resulting in a tie.
